e-pass system created to maintain discipline in the lockdown period. In case of lockdown to prevent people from roaming outside without any reason, there should some sort of authentication system, that only lets people that are in dire need to go outside. This project addresses this problem.

The basic governing rule of the system is the user will request pass and staff will grant a pass.
